# 📘 Java Quiz App – Command Line Edition
This project is a console-based quiz application developed in Java. It presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions, processes their answers, and provides a final score along with feedback.

## 🧠 Objective
The primary goal of this application is to provide a simple and interactive way for users to test their knowledge while practicing fundamental Java programming concepts such as:

Conditionals

Loops

Arrays

Classes and objects

User input handling

## 📌 Features
✅ Displays a series of multiple-choice questions

✅ Accepts and validates user input from the command line

✅ Calculates total score based on correct answers

✅ Provides instant feedback after quiz completion

✅ Supports easy modification and extension with more questions

## 🔍 Use Case
Educational purpose: Teaching or learning Java

Coding practice for beginners

Mini-project for academic submissions

Building blocks for future GUI-based or web-integrated quiz systems

## 📂 Files Included
quizapp.java: Source code for the quiz application

quizapp.class: Compiled bytecode file generated from quizapp.java

README.md: Full documentation of the project

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Language: Java (JDK 8+ recommended)

Environment: Command Line / Terminal

IDE: Any Java-supporting IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

## 🧪 How to Run the Program
1. Compile the Code
bash
Copy
Edit
javac quizapp.java
2. Run the Program
bash
Copy
Edit
java quizapp
The application will present a list of questions one by one. Type your answer (usually a letter like a, b, c, or d) and press Enter.

## 📚 Sample Questions Structure (in Code)
Each question includes:

The question text

Four options

The correct answer indicator

Logic to check and score user input

Example snippet:

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println("1. What is the capital of France?");
System.out.println("a) Berlin\\nb) Paris\\nc) Madrid\\nd) Rome");
String answer = scanner.next();
if(answer.equalsIgnoreCase("b")) score++;
## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By working with this code, users can:

Learn how to structure console-based Java programs

Use conditional logic and loops effectively

Practice user input validation

Understand basic program flow and state management

## 📦 Future Enhancements
Add question randomization

Load questions from an external file (e.g., .txt or .json)

Add timer functionality

Display correct answers at the end

Implement a GUI using Swing or JavaFX
